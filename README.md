# RainAlert
A project that checks the weather forecast of your given city for the next 12 hours and figures out whether it will rain or not.
If the day is rainy or snowy it sends your given phone number an SMS by using the twilio api.
The project is also uploaded into www.pythonanywhere.com for it to run the code every morning at 7AM to check the weather for the day.
And if it seems like it will rain, I get an SMS at 7AM telling me to get an umbrella before leaving the house.
